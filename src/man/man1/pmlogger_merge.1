.TH PMLOGGER_MERGE 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmlogger_merge\f1 \- helper script to merge Performance Co-Pilot archives
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmlogger_merge
[\f3\-fNV\f1]
[\f2input-basename\f1 ... \f2output-name\f1]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmlogger_merge
is a helper script that is used by
.BR pmlogger_daily (1)
when merging all of the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
archives for a single host on a single day
into a combined PCP archive.
.PP
.B pmlogger_merge
is a wrapper script for
.BR pmlogextract (1)
that merges all of the archive logs matching the
.I input-basename
arguments, and creates a new archive using 
.I output-name
as the base name for the physical files that constitute
an archive log.
The
.I input-basename
arguments may contain meta characters in the style of
.BR sh (1).
.PP
If specified, the
.B \-f
option causes all of the input files to be removed once the output
archive has been created.
.PP
Using
.B \-N
option runs
.B pmlogger_merge
in a ``show me'' or ``dry run'' mode where the
tasks that would be performed are reported, but no changes are made.
This is typically used for debugging in combination with one (verbose)
or two (very verbose)
.B \-V
options.

.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.B /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).

.BR PCPIntro (1),
.BR pmlogextract (1),
.BR pmlogger (1)
and
.BR pmlogger_daily (1).
