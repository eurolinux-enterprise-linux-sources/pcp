.TH PMLOGSIZE 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmlogsize\f1 \- report sizes for parts of PCP archive(s)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3pmlogsize\f1
[\f3\-drv\f1]
[\f3\-x\f1 \f2thres\f1]
\f2archive\f1 ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmlogsize
prints information about the size of the index, metadata and data
sections of a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive.
The output is intended to guide improvements in archive encoding
format for PCP developers and to help trim
.BR pmlogger (1)
configuration files to remove metrics that are bloating the PCP archives
with low-value data in production environments.
.PP
The
.I archive
arguments can be any mixture of the names of the physical files
of a PCP archive or the basename that is common to all the
component physical
files in a single archive.  In the latter case
.I archive
is replaced by a list of all of the matching component file names.
.PP
Note the semantics is a little different to other PCP tools in
that
.B foo.meta
means
.B just
the file
.BR foo.meta ,
not
.BR foo.index ,
.BR foo.meta ,
.BR foo.0 ,
etc.
.PP
The
.B \-d
flag requests more detailed reporting.  This means space per instance domain
in a metadata file and space per metric (for values) in a data file.
.PP
The \-r
flag requests additional information about possible replicated values
in the data file and replicated instances in the metadata file.  It implies
.BR \-d .
.PP
When the
.B \-d
(or
.BR \-r )
flag is specified, the
.B \-x
flag may be used to cut off the report after at least
.I thres
percent of the associated space (metric values or instance domains) has
been reported.  The default behaviour is equivalent to
.I thres
being set to 100.
.PP
Additional verbosity can be enabled with one or more
.B \-v
flags.

All are generated on standard error and are intended to be self-
explanatory.
