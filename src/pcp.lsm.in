Title:          Performance Co-Pilot
Version:        @PACKAGE_VERSION@
Entered-date:   @PACKAGE_BUILD_DATE@
Description:    A system performance monitoring infrastructure that is
		distributed and extensible.

		Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) is a framework and services
		to support system-level performance monitoring and
		performance management.

		The PCP open source release provides a unifying
		abstraction for all of the interesting performance data
		in a system, and allows client applications to easily
		retrieve and process any subset of that data using a
		single API.

		A client-server architecture allows multiple clients to
		monitor the same host, and a single client to monitor
		multiple hosts (e.g. in a Beowulf cluster).  This
		enables centralized monitoring of distributed
		processing.

		Archive logging and replay is integrated so a client
		application can use the same API to process real-time
		data from a host or historical data from an archive.

		The framework supports APIs and configuration file
		formats that enable the scope of performance monitoring
		to be extended at all levels.

		The architecture and services of the base PCP
		infrastructure are especially attractive for those
		tackling the harder system-level performance problems.
