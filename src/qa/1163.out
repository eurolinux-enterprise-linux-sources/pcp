PMID: 2.0.7 [PMCD version]
PMID: 2.0.16 [host from which active pmlogger is fetching metrics]
PMID: 2.0.16
This metric encodes the current status of each PMDA.  The default value
is 0 if the PMDA is active.

Other values encode various degrees of PMDA difficulty in three bit fields
(bit 0 is the low-order bit) as follows:

bits 7..0
    1   the PMDA is connected, but not yet "ready" to accept requests
        from the PMDA
    2   the PMDA has exited of its own accord
    4   some error prevented the PMDA being started
    8   PMCD stopped communication with the PMDA due to a protocol or
        timeout error

bits 15..8
        the exit() status from the PMDA

bits 23..16
        the number of the signal that terminated the PMDA
PMID: 2.0.20 [rewritten]
PMID: 2.0.20

PMID: 2.3.1
The fully qualified domain name of the host from which a pmlogger
instance is fetching metrics to be archived.

The instance names are process IDs of the active pmloggers.  The
primary pmlogger has an extra instance with the instance name "primary"
and an instance id of zero (in addition to its normal process id
instance).
