Hinmaton-Yalaktit (or Chief Joseph) (1840 - 1904) was leader of the Nez Perce;
his Indian name means "Thunder Rolling Down the Mountain".

Perhaps you think the Creator sent you here to dispose of us as you
see fit. If I thought you were sent by the Creator, I might be induced
to think you had a right to dispose of me. Do not misunderstand me,
but understand fully with reference to my affection for the land. I
never said the land was mine to do with as I choose. The one who has a
right to dispose of it is the one who has created it. I claim a right
to live on my land and accord you the privilege to return to yours.

Speech rejecting the demands that he lead his people onto a
reservation. (1876)

...

In the treaty councils the commissioners have claimed that our country
had been sold to the Government. Suppose a white man should come to me
and say, "Joseph, I like your horses, and I want to buy them." I say
to him, "No, my horses suit me, I will not sell them." Then he goes
to my neighbor, and says to him: "Joseph has some good horses. I
want to buy them, but he refuses to sell." My neighbor answers,
"Pay me the money, and I will sell you Joseph's horses." The white
man returns to me and says, "Joseph, I have bought your horses, and
you must let me have them." If we sold our lands to the Government,
this is the way they were bought.

Tell General Howard I know his heart. What he told me before, I
have it in my heart. I am tired of fighting. Our Chiefs are killed;
Looking Glass is dead, Ta Hool Hool Shute is dead. The old men are
all dead. It is the young men who say yes or no. He who led on the
young men is dead. It is cold, and we have no blankets; the little
children are freezing to death. My people, some of them, have run away
to the hills, and have no blankets, no food. No one knows where they
are — perhaps freezing to death. I want to have time to look for
my children, and see how many of them I can find. Maybe I shall find
them among the dead. Hear me, my Chiefs! I am tired; my heart is sick
and sad. From where the Sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.

Speech in surrendering to General Nelson Appleton Miles after long
evading a pursuit nearly to the border of Canada. (October 5, 1877)

...

Too many misinterpretations have been made; too many misunderstandings
have come up between the white men and the Indians. If the white man
wants to live in peace with the Indian he can live in peace. There need
be no trouble. Treat all men alike. Give them the same laws. Give them
all an even chance to live and grow. All men were made by the same
Great Spirit Chief. They are all brothers. The earth is the mother
of all people, and all people should have equal rights upon it. You
might as well expect all rivers to run backward as that any man who
was born a free man should be contented penned up and denied liberty
to go where he pleases. If you tie a horse to a stake, do you expect
he will grow fat? If you pen an Indian up on a small spot of earth and
compel him to stay there, he will not be contented nor will he grow
and prosper. I have asked some of the Great White Chiefs where they get
their authority to say to the Indian that he shall stay in one place,
while he sees white men going where they please. They cannot tell me.

I only ask of the Government to be treated as all other men are
treated. If I cannot go to my own home, let me have a home in a
country where my people will not die so fast.

When I think of our condition, my heart is heavy. I see men of my
own race treated as outlaws and driven from country to country,
or shot down like animals.

I know that my race must change. We cannot hold our own with the
white men as we are. We only ask an even chance to live as other men
live. We ask to be recognized as men. We ask that the same law shall
work alike on all men. If an Indian breaks the law, punish him by
the law. If a white man breaks the law, punish him also.

Let me be a free man, free to travel, free to stop, free to work,
free to trade where I choose, free to choose my own teachers, free
to follow the religion of my fathers, free to talk, think and act
for myself — and I will obey every law or submit to the penalty.

Whenever the white man treats the Indian as they treat each other then
we shall have no more wars. We shall be all alike — brothers of
one father and mother, with one sky above us and one country around
us and one government for all. Then the Great Spirit Chief who rules
above will smile upon this land and send rain to wash out the bloody
spots made by brothers' hands upon the face of the earth. For this
time the Indian race is waiting and praying. I hope no more groans
of wounded men and women will ever go to the ear of the Great Spirit
Chief above, and that all people may be one people.
