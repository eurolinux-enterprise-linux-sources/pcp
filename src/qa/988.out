Help:
This is a count of the number of file name directory lookups in XFS
filesystems. It counts only those lookups which miss in the operating
system's directory name lookup cache and must search the real directory

    Data Type: 32-bit unsigned int  InDom: PM_INDOM_NULL 0xffffffff
    Semantics: counter  Units: count
Help:
This is the number of meta-data transactions which waited to be
committed to the on-disk log before allowing the process performing the
transaction to continue. These transactions are slower and more
expensive than asynchronous transactions, because they force the in
memory log buffers to be forced to disk more often and they wait for
the completion of the log buffer writes.
    value 0

    Data Type: 32-bit unsigned int  InDom: PM_INDOM_NULL 0xffffffff
    Semantics: counter  Units: count
Help:
This is the number of meta-data transactions which did not wait to be
committed to the on-disk log before allowing the process performing the
transaction to continue. These transactions are faster and more
efficient than synchronous transactions, because they commit their data
to the in memory log buffers without forcing those buffers to be
written to disk. This allows multiple asynchronous transactions to be
committed to disk in a single log buffer write. Most transactions used
in XFS file systems are asynchronous.
    value 0

xfs.transactions.empty PMID: 11.16.25 [number of meta-data transactions which committed without changing anything]
    Data Type: 32-bit unsigned int  InDom: PM_INDOM_NULL 0xffffffff

change anything. These are transactions which were started for some
purpose, but in the end it turned out that no change was necessary.

Help:
This is the number of times the operating system looked for an XFS
inode in the inode cache. Whether the inode was found in the cache or
needed to be read in from the disk is not indicated here, but this can
be computed from the ig_found and ig_missed counts.

This is the number of times the operating system looked for an XFS
inode in the inode cache and found it. The closer this count is to the
ig_attempts count the better the inode cache is performing.

Help:
This is the number of times the operating system looked for an XFS
inode in the inode cache and saw that it was there but was unable to
use the in memory inode because it was being recycled by another
process.

inode in the inode cache and the inode was not there. The further this

    Data Type: 32-bit unsigned int  InDom: PM_INDOM_NULL 0xffffffff
    Semantics: counter  Units: count
Help:
This is the number of times the operating system recycled an XFS inode
from the inode cache in order to use the memory for that inode for
another purpose. Inodes are recycled in order to keep the inode cache
from growing without bound. If the reclaim rate is high it may be
beneficial to raise the vnode_free_ratio kernel tunable variable to
increase the size of inode cache.

    Data Type: 32-bit unsigned int  InDom: PM_INDOM_NULL 0xffffffff
    Semantics: counter  Units: count
Help:
This is the number of times the operating system explicitly changed the
attributes of an XFS inode. For example, this could be to change the
inode's owner, the inode's size, or the inode's timestamps.

    Data Type: 32-bit unsigned int  InDom: PM_INDOM_NULL 0xffffffff
    Semantics: counter  Units: count
Help:
This variable counts the number of log buffer writes going to the
physical log partitions of all XFS filesystems. Log data traffic is
proportional to the level of meta-data updating. Log buffer writes get
generated when they fill up or external syncs occur.

xfs.log.blocks PMID: 11.16.34 [write throughput to the physical XFS log]
    Data Type: 32-bit unsigned int  InDom: PM_INDOM_NULL 0xffffffff
    Semantics: counter  Units: Kbyte
Help:
This variable counts the number of Kbytes of information being written
to the physical log partitions of all XFS filesystems. Log data traffic
is proportional to the level of meta-data updating. The rate with which
log data gets written depends on the size of internal log buffers and
disk write speed. Therefore, filesystems with very high meta-data
updating may need to stripe the log partition or put the log partition
on a separate drive.

xfs.log.write_ratio PMID: 11.16.78 [ratio of count of XFS log blocks written to log writes]
    Data Type: float  InDom: PM_INDOM_NULL 0xffffffff
    Semantics: instant  Units: none
Help:
The ratio of log blocks written to log writes.  If block count isn't a
"reasonable" multiple of writes, then many small log writes are being
performed - this is suboptimal.  Perfection is 64.  Fine-grain control
can be obtained when this metric is used in conjuntion with pmstore(1)
and the xfs.control.reset metric.

This variable keeps track of times when a logged transaction can not
get any log buffer space. When this occurs, all of the internal log
buffers are busy flushing their data to the physical on-disk log.
