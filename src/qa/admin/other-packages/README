This directory captures the collective knowledge about non-PCP packages
that are required for a PCP build or PCP QA.

These files is the principal drivers for the ../check-vm script.

check-vm -c may be used check the manifest and unavailable files.

manifest
	This is the master list of all packages across all packaging
	frameworks, independent of distro (when more than one distro
	uses the same packaging framework).  For example the lines
	beginning "rpm?" only apply to systems where rpm(1) is the
	principal packaging framework, i.e RedHat, Fedora, SuSE SLES,
	OpenSuSE and Centos.

unavailable
	This file lists the names of packages (or patterns that match
	package names) that are not available for a specific distro
	or distro and version or distro and version and architecture.

skip
	This file lists the names of packages (or patterns that
	match package names, although that is less likely in this
	case) that should not be installed for a specific distro or
	distro and version or distro and version and architecture.
	These are not installed because the packaging is broken or the
	application versions delivered in the package are broken in
	some catastrophic manner.  Each line is prefixed by a comment
	block explaining why the package should not be installed.

skip.<hostname>
	Beyond the general cases captured by the skip file, there
	are some circumstances where a specific package should not be
	installed on a specific host, e.g. dues to conflict with some
	required and installed package that has nothing to do with PCP.

	The format of this file is different to skip and unavailable,
	and lists the packages one per line, prefixed by a comment
	block explaining why the package should not be installed.
