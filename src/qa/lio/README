Pre-Requisites
In order to perform the tests we'll make some assumptions

- python-rtslib is installed
- targetcli is installed
- the lio pmda has been installed successfully (either with selinux disabled
  or with a local policy active)
- you will be able to run the test as the root user (required for interaction
  with configfs)


What the Test does
The test will create an ISCSI gateway based on the sample configuration defined
in iscsi_conf.json. by changing the config you can vary the complexity of the
test.

Once the LIO config is complete, the pmda values are checked to make sure they
match the settings in LIO (via rtslib)

If any of the above checks fail an exception will be raised


Reruns
Once the test is complete, the LIO environment is dropped automatically so you
may rerun the test multiple times or cycle through different configurations



How to Test
1. Make sure the pre-requisites are in place
2. Run the lio_test.py script
