BCC eBPF PMDA
=============

This PMDA extracts live performance data from extended BPF (Berkeley
Packet Filter) in-kernel programs by using the BCC (BPF Compiler
Collection) Python frontend.

pmdabcc loads and acts as a bridge for any number of configured,
separate PCP BCC PMDA Python modules running BPF programs.  Existing
BCC Python tools and programs should be possible to be utilized with
PCP BCC PMDA modules with reasonable effort.  See also pmdabcc(1).

This version of the BCC PMDA includes custom modules as well as eBPF
programs migrated from BCC tools.  In a future release, BCC programs
will be replaced by direct invocation of bcc/tools scripts and the
local copies here will be removed from PCP - once a BCC release
containing the --ebpf option to the bcc-tools is widely available.

All BCC eBPF programs reside in the modules/ subdirectory and are
unchanged from the upstream BCC project.  As a result these eBPF
programs are available under the same license as BCC, not PCP:
