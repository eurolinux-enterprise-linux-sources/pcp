# PCP BCC PMDA main config file - see pmdabcc(1) and PMDA(3)

# NB. Since all the modules are part of the same process, modules may
# not attach to the same kprobes as others or latter ones will fail -
# this is fixed starting with Linux kernel 4.17 / bcc 0.6.0 releases.
# Currently overlapping modules are: biolatency/biotop.

# NB. Cluster IDs 0-99 are reserved for modules migrated or utilizing
# external sources and tools, most notably BCC. Cluster IDs 100-199 are
# reserved for custom modules developed specifically for PCP BCC PMDA.
# Cluster IDs 200-299 are reserved for possible site-local modules.
