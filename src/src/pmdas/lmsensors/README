lmsensors PMDA
==============

This PMDA exports information about the lm sensors on 
compatible motherboards.

The original source code was contributed by Troy Dawson (dawson@fnal.gov)
to the PCP open source project, the reimplementation in Python is from
Christian Horn (chorn@fluxcoil.net).

Metrics
=======

The file ./help contains descriptions for all of the metrics exported
by this PMDA.

Once the PMDA has been installed, the following command will list all
the available metrics and their explanatory "help" text:

	$ pminfo -fT lmsensors

Installation
============

 +  Ensure that /usr/bin/sensors is available, usually provided by the
    lm_sensors package.  On Fedora: 'dnf install lm_sensors'.

 +  # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lmsensors

 +  Check that there is no clash in the Performance Metrics Domain
    defined in ./domain.h and the other PMDAs currently in use
    ($PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH).  If there is, edit ./domain.h to choose another
    domain number.

 +  Then simply use

	# ./Install

    and choose both the "collector" and "monitor" installation
    configuration options -- everything else is automated.

De-installation
===============

 +  Simply use

	# $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lmsensors
	# ./Remove

Troubleshooting
===============

 +  Running with the '--debug 1' or '--debug 2' provides more details.
 +  After installing or restarting the agent, the PMCD log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/pmcd.log) and the PMDA log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/lmsensors.log) should be checked for any warnings or
    errors.
 +  If 'pminfo -fT lmsensors' is not showing the expected values, first
    verify if 'sensors -u' is showing you sensor output.
 +  After setting 'debug' to 1 or 2 in pmdalmsensors.python and
    then running the script from the commandline, debug output
    should be available.
