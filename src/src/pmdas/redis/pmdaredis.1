The hostname (localhost), port (6379 by default) and other configuration
information must be specified in the
\&\f(CW$PCP_PMDAS_DIR\fR/redis/redis.conf file.
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/redis
.br
      # [ edit redis.conf ]
.br
        host=localhost.localdomain:6379
.PP
Once this is setup, you can access the names and values for the
redis performance metrics by doing the following as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/redis
.br
      # ./Install
.PP
To uninstall, do the following as root:
.PP

directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify \fIpmcd\fR(1) when the 
agent is installed or removed.
