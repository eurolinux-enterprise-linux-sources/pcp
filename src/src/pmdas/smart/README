Performance Co-Pilot PMDA for S.M.A.R.T Value Stats
===================================================
This PMDA is capable of collecting statistics from smartmontools

This PMDA collects its data through the smartctl utility and requires that the
smartmontools package is installed in order to function.

Metrics
=======

The file ./help contains descriptions for all of the metrics which are
exposed by this PMDA.

Once the PMDA has been installed, the following command will list all of
the available metrics and their explanatory "help" text:

    + # $ pminfo -fT smart

Installation
============

    + # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/smart

    + Check that there is no clash in the Performance Metrics Domain
      defined in ./domain.h and the other PMDA's currently in use (see
      $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH). If there is, edit ./domain.h to choose another
      domain number.

    + Then simply use

        # ./Install

 	and choose both the “collector” and “monitor” installation
        configuration options.

De-Installation
===============

    + Simply use

        # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/smart
        #./Remove

Troubleshooting
===============

    + After installing or restarting the agent, the PMCD log file
      ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/pmcd.log) and the PMDA log file
      ($PCP_LOG_DIR/PMCD/smart.log) should be checked for any warnings or
      errors.

    + In an event where no values are being returned for most of the
      metrics, check to ensure that there is output given from the
      smartctl utility (needs to be run as root).

          $ smartctl -i -H -A /dev/sda
